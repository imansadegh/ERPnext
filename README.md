# What is ERPNext? 
ERPNext is business management software that helps companies stay on top of their operations, whether it’s tracking inventory, managing finances, handling projects, or keeping customers happy. Think of it as the central nervous system for your business, bringing everything together in one place.

Most ERPs are clunky, expensive, and a headache to customize. ERPNext is different. It is open-source, cloud-ready, and built to be flexible. You get the power of an enterprise system without the usual complications.
